# youtube-downloader
The original intent of this Java program was for me to read the song titles from my [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/) playlists, do a search
on Youtube for the same song (for my entire playlist), and then download the songs into .mp3 or .mp4 format residing in a folder of my 
choice. Unfortunately, I only got as far as my program reading a plain text and querying the youtube videoId because youtube has a strict
[copyright policy](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39933132/download-youtube-videos-with-java-api) regarding downloading music. I tried
using the downloader from [com.github.axet](https://github.com/Litarvan/vget) on 12-10-2019, but it didn't seem to work. Anyways, in
the near future, I will probably code up my own youtube to mp3 converter just to play around and understand how it works.
